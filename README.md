# Longest path distribution for stochastic graphs

This repository implements several existing heuristics for approximating the longest path distribution of a stochastic graph (i.e., a graph for which all node and/or edge weights are random variables). Computing the longest path distribution exactly, or even just its moments, is known to be a very difficult problem - for example, Hagstrom proved that it is #P-complete for discrete RVs - so we typically need to use heuristic methods to get good approximations instead.  

This is a work in progress so will be frequently altered!
