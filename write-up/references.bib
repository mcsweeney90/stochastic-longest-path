	abstract = {Abstract Computational complexity results for two PERT problems are presented. A project is specified by precedence relations among tasks. Task durations are independent random variables with discrete, finite ranges. The following results are obtained: (1) computing a value of the cumulative distribution function of project duration is \#P-complete, (2) computing the mean of the distribution is at least as hard, and (3) neither of the problems in (1) and (2) can be computed in time polynomial in the number of points in the range of the project duration unless P = NP.},,

	abstract = { The variables ξ1, …, ξn have a joint normal distribution. We are concerned with the calculation or approximation of max(ξ1, …, ξn). Current analyses and tables handle the case in which the ξı are independently distributed with common expected values and common variances. This paper presents formulas and tables for the most general case with n = 2. When n > 2, the problem becomes cumbersome. This paper presents formulas and tables that permit approximations to the moments in case n > 2. The moments are approximated by iteration of a three-parameter computation or, alternatively, through successive use of a three-parameter table, which is given. Recent applications of the theory are described. }
